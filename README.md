# delta-force-leaderboard

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8326d92-e905-42fb-b038-8d7b9cf656ae)

This project is designed to process and analyze player statistics from the Delta Force video game using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and data processing techniques. The project consists of several scripts that handle different aspects of the workflow, from preparing the screenshot for OCR, performing OCR on images, processing and cleaning the extracted data, and finally displaying the results in a user-friendly GUI.

Despite its name, this project could be adapted to any video game that features a scoreboard or statistics. The OCR and file structure allows for (not) easy customization to fit different game formats and data structures, making it a versatile tool for analyzing player performance across various games.

It is a also prime example of the capabilities of AI tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and GPT-4. The codebase is entirely generated with the assistance of these language models, showcasing their potential in software development.

# üîë Key Components

### Screenshot cropping (crop_regions.py)
- Opens an image from a specified path.
- Uses the pillow library to crop the image to a specified rectangular region.
- Saves the cropped image to a specified output folder.

### OCR Processing (batch_ocr_processor.py)
- Uses the doctr library to perform OCR on screenshots containing player statistics.
- Configures the OCR predictor with specific detection and recognition architectures.
- Saves the extracted text to a .txt file for further processing.

### Extract Medals (extract_medals.py)
- Detects medal presence using pixel-perfect color threshold analysis
- Supports 4 medal categories: Combat, Capture, Logistics, Intelligence
- Identifies medal ranks (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
- Batch processes multiple images from a folder
- Outputs results to workflow directory

### Extract Team Name (extract_team_name.py)
- Searches for bright pixels (230+ RGB values) in a specific region to detect team presence.
- Crops the team name section using predefined coordinates.
- Processes multiple screenshots in batch mode.
- Saves cropped images to a workflow subfolder with naming pattern team_<original_filename>.jpg

### Data Cleanup (process_match_data.py)
- Reads the OCR output from the .txt file.
- Processes the lines to extract relevant player statistics, including rank, class, name, score, kills, deaths, assists, revives, and captures.
- Tries to fix issues caused by OCR (e.g. wrong or missing characters)
- Maps class symbols to their respective names (e.g., "+" to "Medic").
- Writes the cleaned data to a CSV file (output.csv).

### GUI Display (leaderboard.py)
- Provides a PyQt5-based GUI to display player statistics.
- Includes a PlayerDetailsDialog class to show detailed statistics for a selected player.
- Displays a summary of player statistics, including games played, total score, average score, total kills, total deaths, K/D ratio, total assists, total revives, total captures, best score, average rank, and favorite class.
- Shows a match history table with detailed statistics for each match.

# Example Workflow
### 1. Take a Screenshot

- Take a screenshot right after the round ends or from the match history view.

### 2. Start run.py

- Run `run.py` to process your screenshots and output useful data for `leaderboard.py`.

### 3. Start leaderboard.py

- Next, run `leaderboard.py`. You‚Äôll be prompted automatically to import new data.

# Dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- python-doctr==0.6.0
- python-doctr[torch]
- Pillow>=9.0.0
- typing-extensions>=4.0.0
- pathlib>=1.0.1

# Q & A
- **Q: Can using these scripts result in a ban due to anti-cheat mechanisms?**
- **A:** No, these scripts operate solely on screenshots captured via the print screen button or Steam overlay. They do not interact with the game directly (no memory reading, hooking, etc.), ensuring compliance with anti-cheat policies.
